# TO-DO-IQ

An intelligent to-do list / task management programme, made in python.

## Documentation

### Requirements

TO-DO-IQ is built using only python's native modules. As such, there are no other requirements than an up to date version of python.

### Setup

To setup your own copy of TO-DO-IQ, simply:
- download the repository and unzip the files in the desired location
- run setup.py
- enjoy!

### User interface

TO-DO-IQ utilises the argparse module to deliver a minimalistic yet sleek interface. Argparse syntax and conventions are largely preserved.

Unlike many CLI applications however, the user interface is **interactive**, not a singular executable with optional paramaters to open it with. Upon booting up main.py, you will be guided as to what you can do next. You can also type "exit" to safely close the app at any time.
