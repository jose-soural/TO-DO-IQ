Stuff interacting with last_displayed needs an update. (In the end I'm gonna have to handle it differently)
-- need to add proper behaviour for last_displayed == unsupported, to_do
--- would be good = refactor the "evaluates last_displayed utility to myself" into its own function

--- need to add validation checks to all user_input functions (mainly I forgot with frequency and status)
--- would be good to ctrl + f the input() command and always caseform it
