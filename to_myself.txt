# TO-DO:
- catch the user closing the programme via keyboard etc. and automatically initiate proper exit sequence (= exit function)

# asleep function -- reálně budu prezentovat jako "make it so that it is due on the date so-so. NOte: this takes
# precedence over it's frequency."

# TO-DO:
- musím vlastně u všech (uživatelských) funkcí vychytat případy inputu, kdy je uživatel příliš blbej a zadá neplatný input.
- dates aren't strings -- currently a lot of my functions don't work because of that...

- whoops! forgot the names were in 2 places!

Optimization Considerations

Redundant Operations: In several methods (e.g., set_asleep, change_frequency), tasks are fetched multiple times. Consider fetching the task once and then performing the necessary operations on it.
special Collection: If a task's frequency changes, the task is removed from all special collections and re-added. This is potentially inefficient, especially for large datasets. Consider optimizing this process to avoid unnecessary operations.
"""

The Asleep category needs special treatment. (In most functions)

Stuff interacting with last_displayed needs an update. (In the end I'm gonna have to handle it differently)


A slight error in my code: sometimes I treat the special list as a list of strings, sometimes as its contents. Whoops. Have to fix that.
